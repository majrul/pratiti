Normalization
- 1NF -> Columns in the table should be atomic (single value)
- 2NF -> Columns in the table should not have partial 
		dependency (should be fully dependent on PK)
- 3NF -> Columns in the table should not have transitive 			dependency (cannot have columns which depend on 
					other non pk columns)


TODO:
-> Example on Savepoint


Views
------
- Logical subset or combination of data from one or more tables

- View does not contains data of it's own, it's just like a window through which data from the tables  can be viewed or changed
