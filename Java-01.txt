Java
- Programming Language
  - Similar to C/C++, Python, C#, etc...
- TODO
  - Common features of Java
- To get started with Java
  - Install JDK
    - Libraries
    - Basic tools & utilities
    - Runtime/JVM
  - Install IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, ...)

HelloWorld.java
----------------
public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}

To compile and run the above program, we first need to take care of environment setting (PATH)
- PATH can be set temporarily on the command prompt or permanently from Environment Variables option
  To set the path temporarily:
  - PATH=%PATH%;D:\Apps\jdk-11.0.13\bin

To compile and run the program
- javac HelloWorld.java
- java HelloWorld


Basics of Java
--------------
- Primitive Datatypes (int, float, long, ...)
- Nonprimitive types (Objects)
  - String for ex. is a non primitive/object type
  - Why? -> Because for objects memory is allocated dynamically, whereas for primitives the memory is fixed
- Loops and Conditions (for, while, if, ...)
- Arrays
- OOP (classes & objects)
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
